## Function Calling vs ReAct agent

In this repo, we want to create two scripts, first script to implement function calling agent using Langchain and second script for implementing ReAct agent.

With this repo, we would like to answer following questions:
- Which agent is more optimal?
- Which agent is more costly?

## Conclusion
The answers to the above question will help us to find out what works better and when can we use what.
